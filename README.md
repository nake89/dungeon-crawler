# Unnamed dungeon crawler

## How to install and run

    git clone https://github.com/nake89/dungeon-crawler.git
    cd dungeon-crawler
    make
    ./game

## Status

Nothing is done at all yet. Just started learning C and ncurses. I once created a simple dungeon crawler in C before. But that was long time ago and without ncurses and it was just a disaster.

## To do

- [ ] Create dungeon
- [ ] Create hero
- [ ] Ability to move hero
- [ ] Spawn enemy
- [ ] Make hero die when touch enemy
- [ ] Give hero ability to kill enemy
- [ ] Make enemy follow hero
